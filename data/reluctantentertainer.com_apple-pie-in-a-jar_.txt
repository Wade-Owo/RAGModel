## Homemade Gift: Apple Pie in a Jar Filling

Today I'm sharing my **Homemade Gift: Apple Pie in a Jar Filling**  recipe
that has been on my blog since 2010. This apple filling makes a wonderful gift
to give away. That is what beautiful living is all about this time of year;
giving and sharing with others.

## What is Apple Pie in a Jar Filling?

It's a cinnamon-flavored syrup that is cooked up and poured over sliced apples
that are packed into sterilized jars. After the canning process, the jars
beautifully sit on the counter (or shelves) ready for gift-giving!

## Ingredients for jarred apple pie mix

  * White sugar
  * Cornstarch
  * Ground cinnamon + nutmeg
  * Salt
  * Lemon juice
  * Peeled, cored and sliced apples (make sure and have a variety, including Granny Smith for tartness)

## What to do with Apple Pie in a Jar?

Open a jar and whip up an Apple Goody Dessert!

Serve warm on waffles and ice cream. You can serve it on a panacke or French
toast board. There are so many great options.

Instead of cherries, add this apple pie mixture in place of cherries in this
Black Cherry Almond Crescent Ring Dessert recipe. Or, add a couple jars to
make this Apple Slab Pie recipe.

## Here's how to get started

Taking any of your leftover apples (or even pears), it's always great to make
sure and add in ONE Granny Smith apple for tartness.

**EASY STEPS**

  1. Take 7 1-quart canning jars that are sterilized and allow jars to air dry. Fill the canner with water and start boiling the water to get ready for the canning process. Set aside sterilized 7 lids and 7 rings.
  2. Combine the sugar, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and water in a large saucepan. Place over high heat and cook until thick and bubbly, stirring frequently. Remove from heat and stir in lemon juice.
  3. In each jar tightly pack the apples, adding a variety (but include one Granny Smith in each jar, if not more). Slowly pour syrup over the apples. Take a knife and slide down the sides of the jar to remove air bubbles, and then continue to cover the jars completely with the syrup to about 1 inch from the top. Screw lids on jars.
  4. Carefully lower jars into the canner. Make sure tops of jars are covered by 2 inches of water, leaving space in between jars, submerged in water, and water bath for 30 minutes.
  5. Remove jars from canner and place on a cloth, and tighten the rings of the lids. Turn jars upside down to cool on the counter, so jars seal.

## Perfect food gift for holidays

It's that time of year when we start thinking about others - what we gifts we
can give to them, hostess gifts, or how we can show love to them in other
ways. I love to show love and practice hospitality by giving gifts of food.

Most of my canning supplies I picked up from yard sales years ago.

You can buy canning supplies and a starter kit to get started!

Buying canning supplies is an initial investment, but so worth it. Finding a
mentor to help you get started is another tip that I recommend if you are new
to canning.

## How long do the jars last?

Finally, these sealed jars can be stored for up to a year.

ENJOY!
