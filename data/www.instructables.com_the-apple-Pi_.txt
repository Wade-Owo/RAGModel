## Introduction: The Apple Pi.

from shannon at www.aperiodictableblog.com.  
  
I think it's safe to say this may be the geekiest baking project I've done to
date. And that's saying something, as I am prone to geeking out in the kitchen
a wee little bit. I mean, it's a pie made entirely of apple numbers. And then
topped with more numbers, this time of the crust variety. Oh, and not only
numbers, you see, but the numbers of that beloved symbol of Nerdland (and I
mean that in a good way), Pi. That's right people: I am entering the Pi Pie
Day Competition 2012, and this work of utter nonsense art is my humble
submission.  
  
What a major motion picture production this thing was, although I should say I
really expected it to take longer than it actually did. I've never even been
that great at peeling and coring, much less cutting out shapes from apple
slices, so I prepared for the worst. I bought about 6 million apples, just in
case. I had lemons and 7Up on standby (my mom's secret for keeping apples from
going brown) and I had the sugar/spice filling mixed. Because apples can be so
supremely fussy (and I know this from making a strudel a while ago) that once
you start peeling, you can't stop until the pie is like, in the oven.  
  
So: If you would like to be amazingly nerdy and attempt this pie, I'm going to
dispense with the storytelling and skip right to the tips and suggestions. If
you want to make a normal apple pie, this is a great recipe. It's a sturdy,
straightforward, classic pie with a simple filling. Super-delicious.  
  
**Pi Pie: Tips + Suggestions.**  
  
**1\. The assembly line method is the way to go.** I feel strongly that doing
tasks this way makes things go faster because it allows you to get in a little
zone with whatever it is you're doing. Don't try to peel a few apples, then
stop and do coring, or take a little break to cut a few out. Do all the
peeling, then all the coring, etc. You may start off slow, but you'll be
processing those apples faster than a Martha Stewart intern in no time.  
  
**2\. Just say no to brown apples.** I already gave you the first tip, really,
but make sure you're prepared to house your number cutouts in a shallow baking
dish and in a pool of lemon lime soda and some lemon juice. The soda keeps it
from getting to lemony, and the juice does the heavy lifting. Don't douse
them...think rain puddle. I sprayed mine with the occasional spritz of lemon
juice so I didn't have to jostle them.  
  
**3\. Use cheap plastic cookie cutters.**  Do you know where these numbers
came from? Some big box of assorted plastic cutters I purchased from target
maybe a year ago. One of my most valuable cheap purchases to date; anytime I
need a random shape or thing, it's magically in there. And they worked great
for cutting through the apples. If you have metal ones, that probably works
well too.  
  
**4\. Don't toss those numbers.**  Seriously, unless you want to undo the hard
work you've done, you won't just shovel them around in the brown
sugar/cinnamon filling with a spoon. As they were already laying in my baking
dish, I carefully drained out the excess soda/lemon liquid and poured in my
filling mix. Then, working slowly, I used my hands to basically massage the
filling into and on top of the numbers. You just want to evenly distribute the
filling throughout.  
  
**5\. Store-bought pie crusts are your best friends.**  Before you even think
to ask, no: that is absolutely not even close to being a scratch pie crust.
Thank you for thinking I'm that patient and could take the time to fool with a
scratch pie crust while cutting apple numbers, but let's get real. That is a
perfectly lovely, no-roll, no-mess, no-floury surface, store-bought pie crust.
If I were making a normal pie, I would have tried the scratch crust. This is
not that pie. Besides, I used two whole crusts for the top and bottom of the
pie, plus one additional crust for the cutout numbers on top. Buy two boxes
and you'll be left with one extra you can use later.  
  
**6\. Butter spreaders are fantastic all-purpose tools.** See that there?
That's one of my many butter spreaders. This one, in particular, is a raisin
toast variety. You do not need to use a raisin toast spreader, but you should
buy these things when you see them; they come in handy for everything from
picking the little apple bits that get stuck in your cutters to loosening the
crust numbers off your cutting surface.  
  
**7\. Work slowly and gently.  **When you're ready to fill the pie, gently
slide the numbers from the baking dish into the pie. Cover the pie, do your
cutout crust numbers, and gently place them on the top. When it's time for the
egg wash, take your fingers and gently press down on the numbers you're
washing to hold them in place while you brush over them. Just don't rush it.
by now, you've put in far too much work to ruin it by speeding along. Your
oven will wait.  
  
**8\. Make pie hats.** As you can see, mine got a little dark around a part of
the edge there. I think my pie hat was off-kilter a bit. But the rest of my
pie emerged unburned and nicely golden, which is a direct result of the pie
hat I fashioned from aluminium foil. To make, just take a few short pieces of
foil and shape them so it makes a circle big enough to cover the edges. After
about 20 minutes in there, you'll want to watch your pie, adding the pie hat
when necessary. I had an additional flat piece of foil handy in case the top
started to get too brown before the insides were bubbly.  
  
And there you have it; The Pi Pie Instruction Manual. Is it ridiculous? Yes.
Is it a little fun? Yes. Would I do it again? Perhaps; I like the idea of
cutting apples into shapes, and it's not hard, so I would consider doing maybe
a lattice pie so you could see the filling. Or a crumble. Maybe even use
letters, or different cutters small enough to fit the apple slices. We'll see.  
  
Adapted from _Williams Sonoma's Essentials of Baking: Recipes and Techniques
for Successful Home Baking_.  
  
**Apple Pi Pie (or just Apple Pie.)**  
  
_for the base/top:_  
  
• 2 ready-made pie crusts (or 3, if you're doing the number thing/want any
sort of decorations  
for the insides (please see note below)  
• 6 apples (about 2 1/2 pounds)  
• 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  
• 2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted  
• 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar  
• 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon  
• 1/8 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg  
  
 _for the top of the crust:_  
  
• 1 large egg, beaten  
• 2 tablespoons heavy cream  
• 1 tablespoon granulated sugar  
• 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon  
  
 _Note: If you are making the pi pie shown above, I want you to double
everything listed under the "for the insides" section. You need twice the
apples because the cutout apples don't yield as much as a regular slice-and-
dice would. You need twice the filling because you have to be gentle, and
gentle involves you making double the amount of filling and then pouring it on
in sections, as needed, until it is mixed. You'll have some left over, and
that's ok._  
  
Remember: if you're doing the Pi pie, please look at my tips above, because
the recipe gets too confusing if i go back and forth about the tips for
regular versus pi version.  
  
**it's time for pie:**  
  
to make the filling, peel, halve, and core the apples, then slice the apples
1/4 inch thick. In a large bowl, combine the apples, lemon juice, melted
butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Using a large spoon, stir until
blended. Set the filling aside.  
Position a rack in the lower third of the oven, and preheat to 400ËF.  
  
Roll out the 2 crusts (and by "roll," I mean unroll them from their packages)
and line a 9-inch pie pan with the bottom crust, pressing firmly so crust is
smooth against your pan. Stir the apple mixture again to get the juices
incorporated, spoon it gently into the crust, and smooth the apples into an
even layer. Position the top crust over the filling and trim and flute the
edges. I did a simple edge; you do it how you wish.  
  
Mix your beaten egg with your heavy cream and whip together until
incorporated. Using a pastry brush, brush the top of the pie with the egg
mixture, being careful not to brush the edges. You won't need nearly all of
the egg mixture, so don't feel bad if you have some left over. Mix together
the cinnamon and sugar and sprinkle over the top. Cut 3-4 steam vents in the
top of the crust.  
  
Bake the pie for 15 minutes (did you position your rack to the lower third of
the oven? Hope so. If you didn't, do it before the pie gets in there). When
your 15 minutes has passed, reduce the temperature of your oven to 350ËF and
bake until the top crust is lightly browned, the apple filling is bubbling,
and the apples ar tender when tested through the slit in the crust with a
toothpick, about 40-45 minutes.  
  
Note: about 20 or so minutes into baking, remember your pie hat for the edges.
You are most likely going to need to cover your edges to prevent them from
burning, and anytime after around 20 minutes is when it will begin to happen.
be ready with aluminium foil to cover those edges.  
  
Remove from over and transfer to a wire rack to cool for about 20 minutes.
Serve warm, or let cool completely and serve at room temperature. Store at
room temperature for up to 2 days. That is what the book says. I see nothing
wrong with covering it and sticking it in the fridge to prolong its life.
