There's something about the classic apple pie that never goes out of style.
I'm talking about the good old-fashioned kind with just apples, a sprinkle of
cinnamon and spices, and that golden, flaky crust that makes your kitchen
smell so good. There are no frills, no extras, just the simple joy of apples
mingling with sugar and spice, getting all bubbly inside the crust.

Apple pie is as classic as it gets, just like my grandma's creamy Butterscotch
Pie or this Hoosier Sugar Cream Pie; they're always crowd-pleasers. Like a
good staple, I think everyone needs a simple apple pie recipe, whether you're
planning a traditional holiday dessert for Thanksgiving or Christmas or just
craving our favorite combination of cinnamon and apples.

## Apple Pie Ingredients

  * **Pie Crust:** For this recipe, you will need a double recipe of homemade pie dough to create a bottom and top crust.
  * **Apples:** Using both Granny Smith and Gala apples in an apple pie combines the tartness and firmness of Granny Smiths with the sweetness and softer texture of Galas for a balanced, flavorful filling. Read this guide for the Best Apples for Baking and learn about the different varieties.
  * **Spices:**Cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice bring warmth and depth to the pie, enhancing the apples' natural sweetness and creating a rich, balanced flavor.
  * **Lemon** : Add the zest and the juice. This will keep the apples from browning, adds a bright flavor to the pie, and the pectin in the juice helps thicken the filling.
  * **Flour, sugar and salt** - Flour for thickening, sugar for sweetness and salt for flavor and to help soften the apples. 

## How To Make Apple Pie

**Step 1.** Peel, core, and slice apples into ¼" slices. Toss in a bowl with
lemon zest and lemon juice. Combine flour, sugar, salt, and spices in a small
bowl, then pour over the apples.

**Step 2.** Let the apples sit for 15 minutes to release their juices, then
stir again. Pour the apples and juices into the pie shell, spreading evenly
but mounding slightly in the center.

**Step 3.** Roll out the second dough into a 12" circle. Place it over the
pie, trim, and tuck the edges under the bottom crust, then pinch to flute. Cut
slits for steam, then sprinkle with sugar.

**Step 4.** Place the pie on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake at 425°F for 25
minutes, until golden, then reduce to 325°F and bake for 30-35 minutes, until
the juices bubble and the crust is deep golden.

Let the pie cool before slicing, which can take 3 to 4 hours. If you slice it
too soon, all the juices will run out, which isn't a bad thing, because that's
how to hubby likes his pie.

Tip #1: Let the apples sit in the sugar and spices for at least 15 minutes to
release their juices before adding to the pie shell.

Tip #2: It's important to let the pie cool after baking; the filling needs
time to set and develop its best texture. Cutting into it too early will cause
the filling to spill out.

##  FAQ's

**How should I store an apple pie?**

Apple pie can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days, or in the fridge
for up to 4 days. Be sure to cover it loosely to maintain the crust's texture.
If you need to store it longer, freeze it for up to 2 months.

**Can I use store-bought pie crust instead of homemade?**

Absolutely! Store-bought pie crust is a great time-saver and it works
perfectly with this apple pie recipe for a quick and easy dessert.

**Can I use just one type of apple for this apple pie?**

Yes, that's perfectly fine, just make sure it's a good baking apple that
doesn't go mushy.

  * Trim the edges for the top crust, then tuck the overlap under the bottom crust. Pinch the edge to create a pretty flute.
