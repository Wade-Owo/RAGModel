Apples, covered in a rich buttery caramel sauce and topped with a crispy

I'm done! That's right… I'm D.O.N.E.with summer!

I'm kicking that Diva to the curb! Anyone else tired of the heat and sweating?
It's time to turn my back on her _(Yep …summer is a "she"! Hot, stubborn, and
unrelenting! _Lol _)_  I've decided enough is enough!

To celebrate my divorce from the previous season…even if she hasn't received
the memo yet… I made this delectable "Fall" Dutch Apple Pie for my good friend
and her husband when they came to visit!

Oh my goodness! This pie is the perfect way to say "Howdy Fall!"

## How to Make Dutch Apple Pie

I used my favorite Apple Pie filling which comes from "All Recipes.com"…known
as, Grandma Opal's Apple Pie. Nothing can compete with that buttery caramel
sauce. Grandma Opal knew what she was doing!

You'll need a single pie crust.  My recipe for Pie Crust is amazing!

**TIP: You can purchase a pre-made crust if you want for this pie. Whatever
works best for you.**

### How to Make Caramel Sauce

In a medium sauce pan, melt 1/2 cup unsalted butter. Add in 3 tablespoons of
all-purpose flour to form a paste. Add 1/4 cup water, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1/2
cup packed brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce the temperature and let
simmer for 5 minutes.

## Apple Pie Filling

Fill the bottom of the single pie crust with 8 peeled and cored Granny Smith
Apples cut into nice thick slices. _I like an Apple Pie I can sink_ _my teeth
into!_ If the apples are cut too thin, then the filling turns to "applesauce".
_Ewwwwwwwe!_

Pour the caramel butter sauce over the apples.

Isn't that glorious?!!! I could honestly just eat those crispy apples with
that ooey-gooey caramel sauce.

Movin' along… Time to make that crispy delicate cinnamon crumb topping! This
is the crowning finish to this pie.

### Crumb Topping

In a medium bowl, add 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened, 1 cup all-purpose
flour, 2/3 cup packed brown sugar, 1/4 tsp cinnamon. Cut ingredients together
with a pastry blender/cutter until pea-sized crumbs form.

**TIP: I like to start out with the pastry blender and then switch to my hands
to get a really fine crumb.**

Spread crumb topping over the apple filling going all the way to the edges of
the unbaked crust.

Sprinkle with 1 Tablespoon of granulated sugar. This will help add a little
extra "Crisp" to the top of the crumb!

### Baking Instructions

Place pie on a foil-lined baking sheet. This is a little trick I do to keep my
oven clean, and bake at a 425° degree oven for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes,
reduce heat to 325° for an additional 45 minutes or until the apples are soft,
and the crumb topping is golden.

## Recipe Wrap-Up

The pie will need to cool before serving…unless you like chasing runny pie
filling all over the table. Lol (It's only a tad awkward running your tongue
along the table when _guests are over!)_

Once cool, cut a nice big thick slice for your husband/guest…grab a fork and
the pie plate for yourself and run for the bedroom and lock the door!

The apples are tender with a little crisp. I like them a little on the crispy
side. The buttery caramel sauce thickens and is so tasty with those slightly
tart Granny Smith apples. That crispy cinnamon crumb topping is the BEST!!!
When all those components are combined, it creates the perfect Dutch Apple
Pie!

This pie will have ya licking the plate clean!  Enjoy! _(Only come out of the
bedroom if ya want to!_ Lol _)_

Calories 438 kcal

### Ingredients

  

1x2x3x

  * 1 - 9 inch unbaked pie shell
  * 8 Granny Smith Apples peeled, cored, and thickly sliced

#### Caramel Sauce for filling

  * 1/2 cup unsalted butter
  * 3 Tablespoons all-purpose flour
  * 1/4 cup water
  * 1/2 cup white sugar
  * 1/2 cup packed brown sugar

#### Crumb topping

  * 1/2 cup unsalted butter softened
  * 1 cup all-purpose flour
  * 2/3 cup packed brown sugar
  * 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
  * 1 Tablespoon granulated sugar

### Instructions



  * Preheat oven to 425 °.

#### Caramel Sauce for Filling

  * Melt the butter in a medium saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar, and brown sugar. Bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer for 5 minutes.

#### Assembling Pie

  * Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with prepared sliced apples, mounded gently. Gently pour the sugar and butter caramel liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.

#### Crumb topping

  * In a medium bowl mix softened butter, flour, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Using a pastry blender cut ingredients together until a small pea size crumble forms. You can use your fingers to finish combining to get an even smaller crumb.

  * Sprinkle crumb over the apple slices and caramel sauce, making sure topping goes to the edges. Sprinkle with One Tablespoon of Sugar.

  * Place the pie on a foil lined baking sheet. (This will help keep your oven sparkling clean!)

  * Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce temperature to 350° and continue baking for 35- 45 minutes, until apples are soft and topping is golden brown and crisp.

Hi Ivet!

I get told that a lot! It only made one pie for me I must have a really deep
pie dish? Two pies is a win right? I hope you enjoyed this pie as much as I
do. I love the caramel apple filling with the crumb topping. So good! I need
to make this again.  
Thanks for stopping by. Hope you have a great day!  
Happy Nesting!

Hi! Can I prepare this pie and then pop it in the fridge and then bake the
next morning?

Hi Amanda!  
I emailed you and hope you got the message. You can prepare this ahead of time
and cook it the next morning. If I were doing it though, I'd hold off on
adding the crumb topping until the next morning when I bake it so it doesn't
absorb all the liquids with the apple pie filling. Have a wonderful
Thanksgiving.  
Happy Nesting!

If I make this pie the day before serving, how would I go about reheating it?
Or what would you recommend for making this recipe on a tight schedule? I
can't wait to try this recipe!

Hi Maddie!  
I would recommend making it the day before. I'm making all my pies tomorrow
because of time constraints and oven space. For the Dutch Apple Pie I
recommend just slightly re-heating in the microwave for about 3-4 minutes. You
don't want this pie "piping hot" because the filling will become really runny!
It sets up beautifully, but it does need that cool down time after baking. I
generally just ask my guests if they want their pie "warm" and if so I pop the
slice in the microwave for couple minutes (like 2) and then serve it to them
immediately.  
Hope this helps! Enjoy this pie and have a WONDERFUL Thanksgiving!  
~Norine
