My dad loves to make this special recipe for our kids. It is quick and easy
and absolutely delicious. He made this one with a store-bought crust but if
you make it from scratch it’s even better.

##   Step by Step Recipe Instruction Video:

  

##   Ingredients:

  * 4 large apples or 6 small ones 
  * 60 grams (2 ounces) of butter 
  * 60 grams (2 ounces) of sugar 
  * 2 eggs 
  * Cinnamon (optional)

  

##   Steps to make it:

  * Peel and cut the apples into thin slices. That’s honestly the hardest part of this recipe.
  * Lay the crust into the baking pan and poke a few holes in the bottom using a fork. This will prevent air bubbles from forming under the crust.
  * Spread the apples tightly onto the crust in a circular pattern, starting by placing the larger slices on the outside. Don't be afraid to overlap them a lot, cover the crust with a thick layer of apples.
  * Now the magic of this recipe: melt the butter and pour in the sugar, mix them both well. Crack two eggs and add them to the mix, stirring well (you can use a blender for this). You can also add a bit of cinnamon if you want.
  * Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
  * Pour the butter mix onto the apples and place in the oven.
  * Bake for about 30 minutes, you may need to cover it with aluminum foil if the top starts becoming a little too brown.

Enjoy warm or cold, I guarantee everyone will love it!
