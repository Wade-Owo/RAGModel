This amazing apple pie recipe belonged to my grandmother. I have never seen
another one quite like it! It will always be my favorite and has won several
first place prizes in local competitions. It makes the perfect dessert for
family dinners or during the holidays.

If you're looking for the best homemade apple pie recipe of all time, you've
come to the right place. Grandma Ople's recipe is one of our most popular
recipes ever. Try it today to learn what all the hype is about!

Holiday Baker

##  How to Make Apple Pie

You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the
recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

###  Apple Pie Ingredients

These are the simple ingredients to make this top-rated apple pie recipe:

  * **Apples** : This recipe calls for eight small Granny Smith apples.
  * **Butter** and **flour** : The filling starts with butter and all-purpose flour cooked into a paste.
  * **Sugars** : A blend of white and brown sugar creates the perfect sweet flavor with a hint of warmth.
  * **Pie crust** : Use a store-bought double crust pie pastry or make your own at home.

###  Best Apples for Apple Pie

This recipe calls for Granny Smith apples for a couple reasons: Their firmness
means they will hold their shape during cooking and their tart flavor
perfectly balances out the sweetness of the sugar. Some bakers prefer using
Granny Smith apples in combination with a slightly sweeter variety, such as
Honeycrisp.

###  How to Make an Apple Pie

Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make this old-
fashioned apple pie recipe at home:

  1. **Make the filling** : On the stove, make a paste with flour and butter. Add the sugar and water and bring to a boil. Simmer, then remove from heat.
  2. **Assemble the pie** : Press one crust into a pie plate. Place the sliced apples on the bottom crust. Use the top crust to make a lattice crust according to the recipe below. Pour the butter-sugar mixture over the lattice crust.
  3. **Bake the pie** : Bake the pie in a preheated oven until the apples are soft and the crust is golden brown.

###  How Long to Bake Apple Pie

You'll bake the pie at 425 degrees F for 15 minutes, then you'll reduce the
temperature to 350 degrees F and continue baking for 35-45 minutes. All in
all, the pie will bake for about one hour, give or take a few minutes. You'll
know the pie is done when the apples are soft and the crust is a beautiful
golden brown color.

##  Does Apple Pie Need to Be Refrigerated?

Cover the cooled pie tightly with foil and store at room temperature for up to
two days or in the refrigerator for up to four days.

**Learn more** : How to Store Apple Pie

##  Can You Freeze Apple Pie?

Yes! Since this apple pie doesn't contain custard or cream, it will freeze
quite nicely. Wrap the pie in two layers of plastic wrap and one layer of
aluminum foil. Place it in an airtight container or cover in another layer of
foil. Squeeze out the excess air and freeze for up to three months.

##  Allrecipes Community Tips and Praise

"After 40 years of apple pie-making and dozens of abandoned recipes, this one
is a keeper," says Rita Ryan. "It's become a big hit at holiday feasts and my
pie receives frequent invitations to parties and I get to go along too!"

"I have been making this recipe for close to 15 years," raves Misstexas. "My
kids have literally grown up with it and it’s become a staple at every holiday
meal. Truly a gem! I have given it as a welcome home gift, congratulations
gift, family reunion.. you name it. People that don’t like apple pie will come
by for 2nd helping."

"Pouring the sauce on the outside was a leap of faith, but so worth it, it
makes the top crust slightly crispy and tastes like a churro," according to
one Allrecipes community member.

Oops! Something went wrong. Our team is working on it.

This recipe was developed at its original yield. Ingredient amounts are
automatically adjusted, but cooking times and steps remain unchanged. Note
that not all recipes scale perfectly.  Original recipe (1X) yields 8 servings

  * 8 small Granny Smith apples, or as needed

  * ½ cup unsalted butter

  * 3 tablespoons all-purpose flour

  * ½ cup white sugar

  * ½ cup packed brown sugar

  * ¼ cup water

  * 1 (9 inch) double-crust pie pastry, thawed

## Directions

  1. Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Peel and core apples, then thinly slice. Set aside.

  2. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and stir to form a paste; cook until fragrant, about 1 to 2 minutes. Add both sugars and water; bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.

  3. Press one pastry into the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Roll out remaining pastry so it will overhang the pie by about 1/2 inch. Cut pastry into eight 1-inch strips.

  4. Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight mound. Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples, using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the edges.

  5. Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips, then unfold the first and third strips back into their original position.

  6. Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second and fourth strips back into their original position. Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry. Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch to secure.

  7. Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust, making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.

  8. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.

  9. Serve and enjoy!

### Cook’s Note

This pie is delicious served warm, topped with whipped cream, ice cream, or
more caramel sauce. I personally love it alongside a slice of Cheddar cheese.

I have made this many, many times and each time it comes out perfect! I made
it with a lattice crust, whole crust or open faced with sugar crumble or just
pie crust cutouts, like today. I just pulled it out of the oven and it smells
amazing! I love the recipe just as it is, the taste is great. I have however
added cinnamon on occasion, but the pie really does not need it.Thank You
Grandma Ople for leaving such a great treasure of a recipe behind, for others
to enjoy!!

A keeper! Crowd-pleaser Great flavors

This recipe came out amazing! I trusted Grandma Ople and poured the mixture
over the lattice and it came out perfect. No tweaks, the flavor is excellent
and just like traditional pie somehow! Must be the brown sugar. A huge winner.

A keeper! Worth the effort Crowd-pleaser Easy to follow

Im not a piebaker. Crusts always intimidate me, but this recipe uses ready
made crust that is actually delicious; it turns out light and crispy. I used 7
large granny smith apples and could have used an 8th considering how the
apples cooked down. Also, I poured about 2/3 of the syrup directly over the
raw apples before formimg the lattice top. I poured the remaining syrup over
the lattice crust and openings then used a pastry brush to smooth the syrup
over all the crust evenly. Baked (not convect) as directed and it turned out
picture perfect. My family raved about this pie and the ready made crust makes
it doable for any baker! I know I'll be making it again and again!

Awesome! Just make sure the lattice crust doesn’t prevent the sugar and butter
from soaking through the holes or it will run off the sides. The flavor is
fantastic and my sister-in-law who could be a professional chef, asked for the
recipe. I’ve never done a lattice crust and the simple instructions helped me
out!

This pie is so good! Added 3/8 tsp allspice, 1 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp
Penzey’s Pie Spice to the apples and then tossed 2/3 of caramel sauce with
apples before filling the crust.

A keeper! Easy to follow Crowd-pleaser

I followed the recipe exactly how it’s told and this is the BEST pie I’ve ever
had In My life. I will be saving this and making this often. It was plenty
sweet although I made a little extra filling because my pie pan is just a
little bigger. I did cover the top with foil for the last little bit so it
wouldn’t burn but Holly smokes this recipe is a KEEPER!!
